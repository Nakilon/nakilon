**I code since 1994.  
I'm skilled in Ruby and A.I.  
I can solve unsolvable.**

Here are some of my  
* most successfull and handy projects:
  * [IDHash](https://github.com/Nakilon/dhash-vips) -- the most accurate and fast perceptual image fingerprinting algorithm
  * [PCBR](https://github.com/Nakilon/pcbr) -- ranking algorithm, usable for non-heuristic optimization, agnostic to data distribution shape
  * [nakischema](https://github.com/Nakilon/nakischema) -- object validation with the simplest syntax
  * [p5rb](https://github.com/Nakilon/p5rb) -- Ruby DSL for p5.js
* most fun projects:
  * [RASEL](https://github.com/Nakilon/rasel) -- esoteric programming language
  * converted S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game assets to [NPC/artifacts/etc. maps](https://github.com/Nakilon/stalker-maps)
  * procedurally generated [CS:GO map](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/84n44v/made_aim_and_de_maps_that_are_randomly_generated/)
  * [visual web page structure recognition](https://github.com/Nakilon/pagerecognizer) proof-of-concept
  * utility chat bots (Slack, Telegram, [IRC](https://github.com/Nakilon/nakiircbot), Twitch, [Trovo](https://github.com/Nakilon/trovobot), etc.) -- one of them could learn to talk on the fly
* other projects:
  * [Shelenium](https://github.com/Nakilon/shelenium) -- a tool to automate or test terminal UIs, such as made with curses
  * [directlink](https://github.com/Nakilon/directlink) -- CLI to convert arbitrary webpage URL to direct images links

Sometimes I contribute to popular gems and SDKs with bugfixes or documentation improvements.  
In spare time I translated ruby-lang.org to Russian.  
I can make slides and give a talk.  

If you are a recruiter, here is my [CV in English](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/unversioned.www.nakilon.pro/VictorMaslov_CV2023mar_en.pdf) (updated Mar 2023).  
And recently I started a little cringe [blog](https://nakilon.bearblog.dev/blog/) with notes about coding.
